## Early Life and Entry Into Law Enforcement

Born on March 29, 1975, in Queens, New York, Daniel John Bongino grew up in an Italian-American household that instilled values of hard work and dedication. After earning a degree in criminal justice, Bongino embarked on a path that would lead him to become deeply involved in some of America’s most critical institutions.
